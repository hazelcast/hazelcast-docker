# Checks if we should build the OSS docker image.
# Returns "yes" if we should build it or "no" if we shouldn't.
# If the workflow was triggered by "push" (usually tag push) we should build an OSS image only with these conditions fulfilled:
#  - both (OSS and EE) HZ versions are final release (non-BETA/DEVEL/SNAPSHOT)
#  - both (OSS and EE) HZ versions are equal
#
# The reasoning:
# - For minor releases we will have the same version set (OSS=`6.6.0` and EE=`6.6.0`) which means
# we should build both editions.
#
# - For patch releases we will increment only EE version (i.e. OSS="6.6.0" and EE=`6.6.1`) which means we should build EE only
#
# - If for some reason we will have to build an emergency OSS patch release we should change OSS version
# as well (i.e. OSS="6.6.1" and EE=`6.6.1`) this will mean we should build both editions
#
# - If the workflows was triggered manually by `workflow_dispatch` we assume that the caller knows what they're doing
# so we return "yes" for "All" and "OSS" editions
#
# Check test cases in `oss_build.functions_tests.sh` to see the examples
